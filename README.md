## About The Project

This project was created to provide a modern, stable, and extensible platform for the Madden modding community. It addresses the need for a tool that can handle complex roster data while providing a fluid and intuitive user experience, complete with features like animated transitions and a contextual player header.

The application reads the roster's cryptic data fields, maps them to human-readable names, and presents them in an organized and editable format. All changes are saved back to the roster file in the correct format.

## Key Features

*   **Full Player Editing:** Modify hundreds of player attributes, from physical ratings and contract details to equipment and traits / styles.
*   **Modern, Animated UI:** A polished user interface with smooth, animated tab transitions and a contextual header that always shows the currently selected player.
*   **Live Highlighting of Edits:** Any changed attribute is highlighted in **_bold/italic_**, showing you exactly what you've changed before you save.
*   **Advanced Tools:**
    *   **OVR Recalculation:** Recalculate a player's Overall Rating based on their attributes and archetype.
    *   **Archetype Regeneration:** Automatically determine the best-fit archetype for a player based on their ratings.
    *   **Portrait ID Copier:** Quickly copy all player portrait IDs from a source roster to your current roster by matching player names and positions.
    *   **Bulk Injury Removal:** Instantly clear all active injuries for every player in the roster.
*   **Live Search & Filtering:** Easily find players by name, position, or team.
*   **Standalone Executable:** Packaged into a single `.exe` file for easy distribution and use without needing Python installed.
